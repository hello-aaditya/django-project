In a recent podcast interview with Lex Fridman, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, expressed contemplation regarding the company's name. 
He suggested that a different name might have been more fitting for the company. 
Altman, who co-founded OpenAI alongside Elon Musk and others in 2015, recounted the early days of the company when its trajectory was uncertain. 
Initially conceived as a research lab with a broad vision for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, 
the company later evolved to explore avenues such as API services and chatbot development.

The transition from a nonprofit model, focused on leveraging AI for the benefit of humanity, 
to a "capped-profit" structure in 2019 marked a significant shift for OpenAI. 
This change drew attention, particularly from Musk, 
who voiced concerns about the company's departure from its original nonprofit mission and its shift towards proprietary technologies. 
Musk's discontent culminated in a lawsuit against OpenAI, 
alleging breaches of the company's founding principles and advocating for a name change to "ClosedAI" as a condition for dropping the lawsuit.

However, Altman expressed uncertainty regarding Musk's underlying motivations. 
Despite Musk's criticisms and lawsuit, Altman defended OpenAI's evolution, 
characterising it as a natural response to the evolving landscape of AI technology and the need for increased capital. 
He suggested that the company's evolution was driven by practical considerations and the need to adapt to changing circumstances, 
rather than a departure from its core mission.
